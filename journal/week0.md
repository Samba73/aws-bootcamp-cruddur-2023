          Save preferences and click Manage billing alerts link
          Cloudwatch dashboard is loaded (ensure N.Virgina is selected in the region dropdown)
          In cloudwatch dashboard create new alarm
          Select metric -> Billing -> Total Estimated charge -> Select the Estimatedcharges -> select metrics -> Select Static -> select choice -> click Next
          The billing alter require SNS topic to trigger the alarm. Create a new topic (or use existing if one available) provide topic name and email to create a new topic
          Click next and give alarm name
          Complete the steps and create alarm
          _10 alarms can be created in free tier_
          The alarm takes some time before it gets activated (initially will show as insufficient data</sub>

   ***Difference between Billing alert and Budget Alarm***
     <sub>Billing alert is triggered for billed service charges whereas budget is forecasted estimate of cost alarms.
          Checked cost explorer and reports as part review of billing dashboard
