Apologies for late submission. The CORS issue with Honeycomb (collector) really took most of my time. Reading through many references instead of helping made more confusion and had to change code a lot and take lot of suggestions to implement only to end up still not fixed.

# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

Completed all the videos
Completed all that was done in Live video / Post videos except for x-ray in AWS. Didnt understand the implementation. Also the Honeycomb CORS issue almost exhausted me mentally that I couldnt find time to go back and try X-ray again
I was able to complete Honeycomb tracing for backend as was done in live class
I was able to complete other topics like Rollbar, Cloudwatch 

# Week 2 - Homework challenges

## Instrument Honeycomb for the frontend-application to observe network latency between frontend and backend [HARD].
  ### Tried the best but unable toresolve CORS issue. Many tried to help but no fix. 
  
## Add custom instrumentation to Honeycomb to add more attributes eg. UserId, Add a custom span.
  ### Due to the CORS issue couldnt try this as much is interested
  
## Run custom queries in Honeycomb and save them later eg. Latency by UserID, Recent Traces.
  ### Due to the CORS issue couldnt try this as much in interested
